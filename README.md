# Momentum2017

This is a compilation of code samples for MIT's IAP course, momentum. This year's focus is around developing a rover that can be driven with no visual feedback. 

## Key Concepts

* Controling a Wheeled vehicle
* Wireless Communication
* Data collection and processing
* Interfacing hardware

### Parts

TODO: Link to parts folder with data sheets and diagrams

### Example code

* [WifiServer Example](ServerTestingESP8266/README.md) - This can be used to send commands to the Rover.
* [WifiClient Example](ServerTestingESP8266/ClientTestingESP8266/README.md) - This can be used to send sensor readings to the person driving.
* [IR Sensor Example](IRsensorReading/README.md) - This can be used to read IR sensor data.
* [Motor Example](MotorTesting/README.md) - This can be used to get a motor running.
* [Rover Example](RoverController/README.md) - This can be used to interface the rover with the wifi.
